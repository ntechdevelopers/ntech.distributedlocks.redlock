# Ntech.DistributedLocks.RedLock

A .NET Core implementation of distributed locking using RedLock algorithm for Redis. This project provides a robust solution for distributed locking in distributed systems.

## Project Structure

The solution consists of three main projects:

- **Ntech.DistributedLocks.RedLock**: The main web application project
- **Ntech.DistributedLocks**: Core distributed locking implementation
- **Ntech.RedLock**: Redis-specific implementation of the RedLock algorithm

## Requirements

- .NET Core 3.1
- Redis server(s)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have Redis server(s) running
3. Build and run the solution

## Features

- Distributed locking implementation using RedLock algorithm
- Redis-based locking mechanism
- Support for multiple Redis instances
- Thread-safe operations

## Docker Support

The project includes Docker configuration for easy deployment and testing.
